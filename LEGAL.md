# Legal & Compliance Notes

This project includes simple compliance helpers but is not a substitute for legal advice.

Recommended guidelines:
- Respect `robots.txt` — this project has `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = True` by default.
- Check the target website's Terms of Service and contact them for permission when needed.
- Avoid collection of personal data unless you have a lawful basis and you handle it appropriately (GDPR/CCPA compliance).
- Use rate-limiting and proxies ethically to avoid harming target sites.
- When in doubt, consult with legal counsel.
